# MediSync - Integrated Healthcare Information Management System

MediSync is an advanced backend system designed to manage healthcare information in an integrated and efficient manner. Built with **scalability** and **flexibility** in mind, MediSync is capable of handling growing datasets and evolving healthcare needs. The system is built with **Java** using the **Spring Framework**, ensuring high performance, extensibility, and ease of modification to meet future requirements.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Full functionality to manage user profiles (doctors, patients, administrators).
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Flexible appointment scheduling, updating, and cancellation system.
- **Patient Records**: Secure management of patient medical records.
- **Doctor Availability**: Real-time tracking of healthcare provider availability for appointments.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restricts functionality access based on user roles, ensuring data security and privacy.

## Scalability & Flexibility

MediSync is designed to scale efficiently as the number of users, appointments, and patient records increases:

- **Database Scalability**: Supports a wide variety of databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), allowing you to choose the best database for your scaling needs. The schema can be easily adjusted to meet growing data storage needs.
- **Microservices Ready**: MediSync is structured to allow easy migration towards a microservices architecture as the need for distributed systems arises.
- **Extensible Codebase**: The code is designed to be easily extendable and customizable. New business logic can be integrated with minimal changes to existing code, supporting future growth and evolving requirements.
- **API-First**: The backend provides a robust REST API, making it easy to connect with web and mobile front-end applications, as well as external services, ensuring high interoperability.
